# time-in-words
This project contains a COBOL Code which converts time in 'HHMM' format to words like:

> IT IS TWENTY SIX TO ONE IN THE AFTERNOON

The inspiration for this little project, came from SKMEI 2312 - a watch from SKMEI, a chinese watch manufacturer. SKMEI 2312 is an homage to the QlockTwo W watch.

| File                          | Description |
|-------------------------------|-------------|
| `TimeToWords-CurrentDate.cbl` | A COBOL program that uses `FUNCTION CURRENT-DATE` to get system time and display it in words. |
| `TimeToWords-InputFile.cbl`   | A COBOL program that reads all 1440 possible `HHMM` values from `INPUT.DAT` and generates `OUTPUT.txt`. |
| `INPUT.DAT`                   | Contains all possible time values from `0000` to `2359`, one per line. |
| `OUTPUT.txt`                  | The output file generated by TimeToWords-InputFile.cbl program. Contains the time in words for each HHMM value in the INPUT.DAT file. This file is hosted on GitHub Pages for blog display via JavaScript. |

## üåê Live Blog Widget

This project powers a live **retro-style clock widget** on my blog:

üîó [iamamainframer.blogspot.com](https://iamamainframer.blogspot.com/)

The widget fetches the appropriate time-in-words from `OUTPUT.txt` every minute and displays it in mainframe terminal style (green on black).

## ü§ñ Tools Used

- **COBOL** (via OpenCobolIDE / GnuCOBOL)
- **GitHub Pages** to host `OUTPUT.txt`
- **JavaScript** + Blogger to build the widget
- **ChatGPT** and **Gemini** for code generation and validation

## üß™ How to Run Locally

If you'd like to run the COBOL code, there are several options:

1. Install [OpenCOBOL IDE]([https://open-cobol.sourceforge.io/](https://pypi.org/project/OpenCobolIDE/))
2. Open `TimeToWords-CurrentDate.cbl` or `TimeToWords-InputFile.cbl` on OpenCOBOL IDE.
3. Click on the Run button to execute the code and observe output or generated files.
